                                Morningstar undertakes both quantitative and qualitative fund research, which creates a holistic view of funds by combining an assessment of past performance with a forward looking opinion. Morningstar conduct regular face-to-face meetings with Fund Managers and undertake reviews in relation to performance, personnel, strategy, research capabilities and other qualitative factors that may impact the Fund Manager’s ability to achieve the desired investment results.<br/><br/>
                                Morningstar’s research is then analysed by our own internal Investment Team and is presented to our Investment Committee who meet regularly to discuss findings from the on-going fund research and the effect of continuing with these funds or replacing them with better options. The end result is a list of recommended funds to consider alongside supporting guidance on how these funds may fit within a portfolio or behave in market environments.<br/><br/>
                                Recommended Funds are monitored on an ongoing basis and recommendations are updated as soon as possible following any event deemed material to our opinion of a fund (e.g. a manager or strategy change) or at least quarterly, whichever is sooner.

It is based on past data, may change over time and may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund .
